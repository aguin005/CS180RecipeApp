Summary:

In the realm of culinary exploration, our proposed project aims to redefine the way users interact with recipes and streamline their grocery shopping experience. The core functionality centers around allowing users to select recipes seamlessly, with detailed information on ingredients and their prices fetched directly from the use of APIâ€™s (Spoonacular).
