# Summary:

In the realm of culinary exploration, our proposed project aims to redefine the way users interact with recipes and streamline their grocery shopping experience. The core functionality centers around allowing users to select recipes seamlessly, with detailed information on ingredients and their prices fetched directly from the use of API’s (Spoonacular).  

# How to build and run our recipe app

Source Code: https://github.com/daniel-sadeghi/CS180GroupProject/tree/main  

To build and run our recipe app after pulling the main branch from the github repository.
Before going into the steps, make sure you are in the recipe-expo-app directory in your terminal.
First check if you have npm and expo installed, if not you can follow these docs https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/ and https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Then after you have these installed, you first want to run (npm install –legacy-peer-deps)
To start the app, use npm start (or npx expo start), this will run a sequence of commands that will start the app and then generate a QR code to scan on your phone (make sure you have the Expo Go app installed on your mobile device, both devices connected to the same internet connection).
Once scanned expo go will launch and then you can freely explore the app!
