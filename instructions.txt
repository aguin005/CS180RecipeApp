To get started with working in React and Expo, follow the instructions found here:
https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project

Download Node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/

Important part of the React Page is the Expo portion:
Using Expo (for native apps) 

Using Next.js (Have to work on this part still)

Figma is a Prototyping Application that allows us to vizualize what we want the app to look like.
I added elements that you guys can use and made a basic couple of screens you guys can add to.
This is mostly for frontend design but will also help us find out what we need to add for the backend.

WHen working with Expo, here's a tutorial on how to get started, I have made a starting project that you guys can look at.
https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/

To start the app type:
npm start -- --reset-cache

To get expo commands to work you have to open windows powershell as an administrator and type:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

If you need to reset the node modules use the commands:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json 
npm install

or 

Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

Some helpful commands that fixed errors for me:
npm install -g npm@latest
npm cache clean -f
npm install react-navigation react-navigation-stack react-navigation-tabs
expo install react-native-reanimated 
npm install --save babel-preset-expo
expo upgrade
